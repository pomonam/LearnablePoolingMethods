# How to contribute

We are accepting patches and contributions to this project. To set expectations,
this project is primarily intended to be a flexible starting point for
researchers working with the YouTube-8M dataset. As such, we would like to keep
it simple. We are more likely to accept small bug fixes and optimizations, and
less likely to accept patches which add significant complexity. For the latter
type of contribution, we recommend creating a Github fork of the project
instead.

If you would like to contribute, there are a few small guidelines you need to
follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. This is necessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even
after your contribution becomes part of this project. So this agreement simply
gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current
agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more
information on using pull requests.
