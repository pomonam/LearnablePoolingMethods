# Learnable Pooling Methods for Video Classification
The repository is based on the starter code provided by Google AI. It contains a code for training and evaluating models for [YouTube-8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/) dataset. The detailed table of contents and descriptions can be found at [original repository](https://github.com/google/youtube-8m).

Our approach was accepted in [ECCV - The 2nd Workshop on YouTube-8M Large-Scale Video Understanding](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/workshop2018/index.html). The paper and presentation will be release soon.

At the moment, we are refactoring our code for reusuability.
