# YouTube-8M Tensorflow Starter Code
This repo is a copy of a starter code provided by Google AI. It contains a code for training and 
evaluating machine learning models over the [YouTube-8M](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/) dataset. This is the starter code for our [2nd Youtube8M Video Understanding Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/youtube8m-2018) and part of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2018 selected workshop session. 
Detailed table of contents and descriptions can be found at the [original repository](https://github.com/google/youtube-8m).
